# Discord-counting

## Purpose of the script

* The goal of this script is to automate counting (Discord bot) on a Discord server using two Discord accounts  
* This script is designed to work exclusively with the following bot: counting#5250
* It is only compatible with Linux computers
* The script sends 1000 messages before stopping

## To make the script work well:

1. You must have two Discord accounts and be logged into both
2. Set up both of your Discord counting pages (Discord client + Discord on any browser)
3. Once you run the script, navigate to the first Discord page where you need to enter the initial number
4. Make sure that the second Discord page is directly accessible with Alt+Tab
5. The script will now send messages to the Discord counting channel
6. If you need to stop it, use Alt+Tab immediately after the 'return' part of the script pattern to access the terminal, then press Ctrl+C in the terminal

## Some more advices

* After using the script once, wait at least 2 hours from the time the 1000th message was sent before using it again
* You might need to reboot your computer if your login screen becomes locked while the script is still running

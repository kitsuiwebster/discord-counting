# Discord-counting

## Purpose of the script

* The purpose of this script is to automate the counting (Discord bot) on a Discord server, with 2 Discord accounts
BOT ID: 510016054391734273

* It can only be used on Linux computers
* The script sends 1000 messages and then stops

## To make the script work well:

1. You first need to have 2 Discord accounts and need to be logged in both of your pages
2. Prepare both of your Discord couting pages (Discord client + Discord on any browser)
3. Once you run the script go on the first Discord page, where your need to type the first number
4. Make sure that the second Discord page is directly accessible with Alt+Tab
5. The script is now sending messages on the Discord counting channel
6. If you need to stop it, use Alt+Tab right after the 'return' part of the script pattern to access the terminal, then press Ctrl+C in the terminal 

## Some more advices

* After 1 utilisation, wait 2 hours or more from the moment the 1000th message has been sent
* You may need to reboot your computer if your log screen get locked while the script is still running
